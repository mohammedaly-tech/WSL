# Instructions for Training on TG3K and TN3K Datasets

## 1. Setup the Environment
- Install Python 3.7 or above.
- Install dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 2. Dataset Preparation
- Download the TG3K dataset from the following link:
  - [TG3K Dataset](https://github.com/openmedlab/Awesome-Medical-Dataset/blob/main/resources/TG3K.md)
- Download the TN3K dataset from:
  - [TN3K Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1reHyY5eTZ5uePXMVMzFOq5j3eFOSp50F/view)

### Organize the Datasets:
- Place the **TG3K** images and masks in a folder structure like:
    ```
    data/tg3k/
        ├── images/
        └── masks/
    ```
- Place the **TN3K** images and masks in a folder structure like:
    ```
    data/tn3k/
        ├── images/
        └── masks/
    ```

## 3. Training the Model
- To train the model on the TG3K dataset, run:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
- The model will automatically save the weights and log the loss during training.

## 4. Testing the Model
- To test the model on the **TN3K** dataset:
    ```bash
    python train.py --test
    ```

## 5. Model Architecture
- We use a **U-Net** architecture for segmentation tasks, implemented using PyTorch.

## 6. License
- The code is released under the **MIT License**, allowing you to freely use and modify the code for your own purposes.

Instructions to Run Weakly Supervised Segmentation Code:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary libraries if you don't have them already:
   Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   
   pip install torch

3. Prepare your dataset and note its path.
   The script will prompt you to provide the path to your dataset when you run it.

4. To run the script:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder where the Python file is saved.
   - Run the script using the following command:

   python weakly_supervised_segmentation_with_input.py

5. When prompted, enter the full path to your dataset and press Enter.

6. The code will process the dataset and run the weakly supervised segmentation framework.

7. Check the output for the final segmentation map or loss values.
